			<h2 id='about'>About Me</h2>
			<p> Since I was a kid, technology and computers have been my biggest interests. Thus, there was no hesitation in chosing software engineering as my
			major after high school. I got my Bachelor's degree from The University of Western Ontario in the year 2025. Since then, I've been working on personal projects
			to strengthen my portfolio as well as working with several companies under a job contract. 
			</p>

			<h3 id='qual'>Qualifications</h3>
			<p>Throughout my 4 years of experience as a software engineer, the secret has always been in the creativity, persistance, and passion I have as
			a person. My creativity helps me in problem solving as well as coming up with new ideas and knowing where to start from. My passion and persistance, however,
			are what help me apply those ideas or solve those problems in a sufficient and effective way.</p>

			<h4 id='work'>Work Examples</h4>
			<p> Throughout my career, I've had many great ideas and projects. However, two of these projects exceded my expectations in terms of success and formed a turning point
			in my career as a software engineer. Here are the links to my top two projects:
